  <p>Deep learning research paper implementation</p>

  <p>inputs -> (streetview + satellite) images</p>
  <p>outputs -> housing price, people per building, greenery coverage %
  <p>I wanted to learn deep learning with real data and following a research paper seemed like the best option. Most of the steps are already outlined in the paper and I just had to follow along. I am inspired by the level of enhancement deep learning can bring to outdated processes such as data collection in urban planning. I enjoyed learning and using geopandas on this one! It took my pc days to download the images from google and to train the models so I'm glad that the models performed well on the test data set. Way more info on the readme... Check it out!</p>
